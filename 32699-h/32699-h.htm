<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This Supplement is designed to supply a double need: it furnishes an
analytical index to the entire series of twenty volumes; and it affords
a great deal of additional information, bearing on the subject-matter of
these volumes, but which from its very nature it was impossible to
incorporate in the text. This additional information includes
biographical sketches of the characters mentioned in each volume;
similar sketches of prominent Canadians who for one reason or another do
not appear in any of the twenty volumes; and brief descriptions of wars,
battles, treaties, and political and other events having a vital bearing
on the history of Canada. References have been added, wherever
necessary, to the principal sources which the student may consult for
further information. The whole has been thrown into one alphabetical
arrangement, and it constitutes, to a large extent, a dictionary of
Canadian history.</p>

<p>To satisfy further the desire of those who, after reading the foregoing
volumes, find it profitable to investigate more fully certain lines of
inquiry suggested by the narratives, it has been thought advisable to
add a list of manuscript sources from which new material may be gleaned.
The collection of documents most convenient for this purpose is to be
found in the Dominion Archives. It is not possible in the present work
to do more than indicate the principal documents, as there are fifteen
thousand volumes of manuscript in the Archives bearing on Canadian
history. The sources indicated here are drawn principally from the
series designated A, B, C, F, Q, M. The letter refers to the series, and
the number to the volume. The Calendars published by the Archives in the
Annual Reports should also be consulted by the student. For convenience
of reference, it has been deemed preferable to group the manuscript
sources under general headings, and print the list as a separate section
in the volume.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the bibliographical references, the object has
been to include only those works that have a direct and vital bearing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>the subject. A complete bibliography in each case would obviously be
neither possible nor desirable. Nor, except in special cases, has any
attempt been made to include articles or papers in periodicals or in the
publications of learned societies. It will be sufficient to make a
general reference here to some of the more important sources of
information on the many topics covered in this volume. First among these
sources probably should rank the publications of the Royal Society of
Canada. The Society has published in a separate volume a very full
General Index to its <i>Proceedings and Transactions</i>, 1882-1906, compiled
by Dr. Benjamin Sulte. For volumes subsequent to 1906, the individual
indexes should be consulted. A key to the Annual Reports of the
Geological Survey of Canada is found in two General Indexes, one
covering the years 1863-1884, and the other the years 1885-1906. The
latter, compiled by F. J. Nicolas, is very complete. Wurtële's Index to
the <i>Transactions</i> and other Publications of the Literary and Historical
Society of Quebec, 1829-1891, furnishes a guide to the material issued
by this oldest of Canadian learned societies. Unfortunately, no general
index is available for the publications of the Canadian Institute, which
cover a very wide and important field; nor for those of the Historical
and Scientific Society of Manitoba, the Ontario Historical Society, the
Nova Scotia Historical Society, and various other Canadian institutions
of a similar character. Much important material, bearing on, or
supplementary to, the topics treated in the several volumes of the
<i>Makers of Canada</i> will be found in the foregoing publications. The
reader may also find it profitable in many cases to consult the
publications of the American Historical Association, and the State
Historical Societies of New York, Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota. A great deal of important material is also to be found in
Canadian and other periodicals. Of the more significant of these, the
<i>Revue Canadienne</i> marked the completion of its fifty-third volume in
1907 by publishing in separate form a comprehensive Index to the entire
series up to that year. In consulting other Canadian magazines,
reference must in most cases be made to the individual indexes in each
volume. The series of the <i>Canadian Monthly</i> and the <i>New Dominion
Monthly</i> are, however, fully covered by Poole's <i>Index</i>; the <i>Canadian
Magazine</i>, to a large extent, by Wilson's <i>Guide to Periodical
Literature</i>, as well as by a General Index published by the magazine in
1907. A key to the publications of several Canadian historical societies
and periodicals, since the year 1906, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> furnished by the <i>Magazine
Subject-Index</i> (Boston). The three admirable American guides mentioned
above, that is, Poole's <i>Index</i>, Wilson's <i>Guide</i>, and the <i>Magazine
Subject-Index</i>, with their annual or cumulative supplements, provide
also a key to the great body of literature in the principal American and
English periodicals, bearing on Canadian topics.</p>

<p>Among other important guides to Canadian subjects, historical,
political, biographical, social, literary, and scientific, should be
mentioned the <i>Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada</i>,
edited by Wrong and Langton; Larned's <i>Literature of American History</i>,
which includes a section on Canada; the various encyclopædias; the
annual bibliographies of Canadian scientific work published in the
<i>Transactions</i> of the Royal Society of Canada; Gagnon's <i>Essai de
Bibliographie Canadienne</i>; Morgan's <i>Bibliotheca Canadensis</i>; James's
<i>Bibliography of Canadian Verse</i>; Horning and Burpee's <i>Bibliography of
Canadian Fiction</i>; Tanguay's <i>Dictionnaire Généalogique des Familles
Canadiennes</i>; and the very full bibliographies of material published in
or about the province of Quebec, by Dr. N. E. Dionne. A general
reference may also be made here, for all subjects in this volume
relating to Canadian history, to such general works as those of Parkman,
Kingsford, Bourinot, Dent, McMullen, Ferland, Faillon, Charlevoix,
Bibaud, Garneau, Sulte, Miles, Christie, Haliburton, Murdoch, Campbell,
Hannay, Bryce, and Begg. In addition to the principal source of Canadian
manuscript material, the Archives at Ottawa, a large number of important
documents will be found in the Provincial Archives at Halifax, Quebec,
Toronto, Winnipeg, and Victoria, as well as in the universities of
Laval, McGill, and Toronto. Finally, reference may be made to the
various biographical dictionaries in the accompanying list.</p>

<p>The inclusion in the Supplement of several names of Canadians, both
living and dead, who are not of the very first importance, and the
omission of others who filled at least as important a place in the
history of the country, will be explained largely by the fact that the
former were incidentally mentioned somewhere in the series, and
therefore had to be included, while the latter were not.</p>

<p><b>Abnaki Indians.</b> A tribe of the Algonquian family, inhabiting a portion
of what is now the province of New Brunswick. They were early converts
of the French missionaries, and made common cause with the French
against the English colonists. A number were brought to Canada in the
seventeenth century, and formed a settlement on the St. Francis River, a
few miles above its junction with the St. Lawrence. The Indian town was
destroyed by Robert Rogers in 1759. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Hostile to New England,

<p><b>Acadia.</b> The name Acadia or "la Cadie" is found as early as Nov. 8, 1603,
in the commission of Henry IV appointing Pierre du Gua, Sieur de Monts,
lieutenant-general in La Cadie, extending from the fortieth to the
forty-sixth degree of north latitude. The limits were afterwards
reduced, and the boundaries of Acadia became a cause of contention
between France and England. France claimed that the English possessions
were restricted to the peninsula of Nova Scotia, and that the territory
now known as New Brunswick had not been ceded to England. The first
settlement in Acadia was on the Island of St. Croix in 1604, but the
following year it was transferred to Port Royal, and abandoned in 1607.
Three years later the Sieur de Poutrincourt established a new settlement
at Port Royal, which was destroyed by Argall in 1613. In September,
1621, James I granted the territory of Acadia, under the name of Nova
Scotia, to Sir William Alexander. This grant was renewed in July, 1625,
by Charles I. A small Scottish settlement was established at Port Royal
by the grantee. Acadia was restored to France by the treaty of St.
Germain-en-Laye in 1632, and during the same year new settlers were
brought from France. Acadia was finally ceded to Great Britain by the
treaty of Utrecht in 1713. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Its resources and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> limits, 18;

<p><b>Acadia College.</b> Situated at Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Founded by the Nova
Scotia Baptist Education Society, 1838. Application made to the Nova
Scotia Assembly for incorporation as "The Trustees, Governors and
Fellows of the Queen's College." The corporation created with university
powers, 1840. At the next meeting of the Legislature its name changed to
Acadia College. Power of appointing governors transferred from the
Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces,
1851. Final changes in the Act of Incorporation, 1891. <b>Index</b>: <b>H</b> Founded

<p><b>Acadians.</b> The first permanent settlers were those who came with De
Razilly in 1632, and from these the Acadians of to-day are descended.
Other French immigrants were brought by d'Aulnay de Charnisay from 1639
to 1649, and by La Tour and Le Borgne in 1651 and 1658 respectively.
There were also small immigrations at divers later dates. The first
general nominal census was taken in 1671, and gave a population of 392
souls. In 1686 there were 885 persons in Acadia. Seven years later the
inhabitants numbered 1018. When Acadia was ceded to Britain in 1713, the
Acadian population was 2500. Although from 1713 to 1745 a number of
families had escaped to the new French colonies of Isle Royale and Isle
St. Jean (now Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island), still in 1749, when
the British settled Halifax, there were about 12,500 Acadians in the
province. Another large influx of population to the same colonies, and
to the St. John River, took place between 1749 and 1755, yet there
remained in the latter year in the peninsula and in the Isthmus of
Chignecto some 10,000 inhabitants, of whom nearly 7000 were deported in
1755. The rest escaped to the woods; some went to Miramichi, and later
to Baie des Chaleurs; others crossed over to the Isles Royale and St.
Jean, and quite a number found their way to St. John River, and from
thence to the province of Quebec. The whole population of Acadians in
the peninsula, the Isthmus of Chignecto, the St. John River, Isle
Royale, and Isle St. Jean, at the time of the expulsion, is computed at
16,000. <b>Bib.</b>: Murdoch, <i>History of Nova Scotia</i>; Campbell, <i>History of
Nova Scotia</i>; Haliburton, <i>Historical and Statistical Account of Nova
Scotia</i>; Hannay, <i>History of Acadia</i>; Raymond, <i>St. John River</i>; Gaudet,
<i>Acadian Genealogy</i> (Report on Dominion Archives, 1905, vol. 2).</p>

<p><b>Acadians, Expulsion of the.</b> Governor Lawrence in 1755, with the advice
of his Council and of Admirals Boscawen and Mostyn, but apparently
without consulting the home government, decided that the Acadians must
be deported from Nova Scotia. The reason for this decision was the
obstinate refusal of the Acadians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> to take the oath of allegiance, and
the conviction of the governor that the safety of the colony depended
upon their expulsion. In September, 1755, all preparations having been
made with the utmost secrecy, Monckton at Beauséjour, Winslow at Grand
Pré, Murray at Piziquid, and Handfield at Annapolis, seized the
inhabitants and held them prisoners until the arrival of the transport
and provision ships. These having been delayed, the final embarkation
did not take place until late in December. The Acadians were distributed
among the British colonies along the Atlantic seaboard. Some hired
vessels in 1763, and sailed to Miquelon, and in 1767 and following years
returned gradually to their old Acadian home. Others came directly to
Nova Scotia in 1766, there being no longer any reason for their
exclusion, while others went north to Quebec or south to Louisiana. The
present Acadian population in the three Maritime Provinces is over
150,000, and these are the descendants of the few families who escaped
deportation, and of those who returned from exile. <b>Index</b>: <i>See</i>

to further agricultural interests, but Quebec owes most to J. F.
Perrault (<i>q.v.</i>), and Nova Scotia to John Young (<i>q.v.</i>). An
agricultural school was founded at Ste. Anne de la Pocatière in 1859;
the Guelph Agricultural College was established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> in 1874; the Nova

States contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> was that the boundary should follow a line
approximately parallel to the coast and thirty marine miles distant
therefrom; the Canadian, that it should follow the summit of the first
range, crossing many of the inlets near their mouths. The decision of
the Joint Commission of 1903 did not concede the United States claims in
full, but gave them an unbroken littoral, substantially what they had
contended for. <b>Index</b>: <b>D</b> Effect of Russian occupation, 38; early history

<p><b>Allan, Sir Hugh</b> (1810-1882). Founder of the Allan line of steamships.
Came to Canada from Scotland, 1826, and in 1831 entered the shipbuilding
firm of James Millar &amp; Co., Montreal, of which he became a partner in
1835. In 1853 his firm began building iron screw steamships, and their
first vessel, the <i>Canadian</i>, made its first voyage in 1855. The
following year, with a fleet of four vessels, a regular service was
opened between Canada and England, with fortnightly sailings. In 1859
the fleet was increased to eight steamers, and a weekly service opened.
From these small beginnings, the Allan Line has risen to a foremost
place in transatlantic transportation. <b>Index</b>: <b>Md</b> President of the

Council, and registrar of enrolments, but because of his opposition to
the government, Murray refused to admit him to office. In April, 1768,
Carleton confirmed him in these appointments, which he retained until
superseded by George Pownall in 1775. From 1771 to 1776 deputy
commissary-general. One of the original members of the Legislative
Council, under the Quebec Act. In 1780, when the Legislative Council
presented an address to Haldimand opposing the passing of an ordinance
amending the judicial system of the province in accordance with royal
instructions to the governor, voted against the address and caused a
strongly worded protest to be entered in the minutes of the Council.
This action resented by members of the Council, and ultimately led to
his dismissal by Haldimand, February, 1783. <b>Index</b>: <b>Hd</b> Member of Council

<p><b>American Invasion</b> (1775-1776). Grew out of the belief entertained by the
rebellious colonists that the French of Canada could readily be won to
their side. As a matter of fact the latter, while for the most part
showing no enthusiasm to join Carleton's forces, were still less
inclined to coöperate with the invading army under Montgomery and
Arnold, or to support the movement for union with the New Englanders. On
the other hand, the Americans had a number of English-speaking
sympathizers in Montreal&mdash;men who had come there from the colonies to
the south. This, and its geographical position, made the capture of
Montreal an easy matter; but Quebec was a different problem. Here
Carleton gathered a small but efficient force of regulars and militia,
and successfully held the town against the invading army. Montgomery was
killed in the assault, Dec. 31, 1775, and in the spring of 1776 the
siege was raised. The invading army hastily retreated to Montreal, and
finally was driven out of the country. <b>Index</b>: <b>P</b> Joseph Papineau carries

<p><b>Archives.</b> Provision was made by the Parliament of Canada, in 1872, for
an Archives Branch, and Douglas Brymner was appointed Dominion
Archivist. His first report appeared in 1873. The earlier reports were
of a preliminary nature, but in 1884 the first of the important series
of calendars was included in the report. Abbé Verreau made a special
report on historical material in Europe bearing on Canadian history,
published in 1874. A report on manuscript material in the colonial
archives at Paris, by Edouard Richard, was published as a supplement to
the report for 1899. Dr. Brymner died in 1902, and Arthur G. Doughty was
appointed Dominion Archivist in 1904. The report for 1905, in 3 vols.,
represented a new departure; the publication of calendars was abandoned,
and replaced by volumes containing series of documents relating to
definite subjects, systematically arranged. The archives were moved into
a special building in 1907. In 1910 began the issue of a series of
publications, containing historical journals and other special material.
Provincial archives, of a more or less distinct character, have also
been established in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia,
British Columbia, Manitoba, and Alberta. <b>Index</b>: <b>Hd</b> Quoted, 254;

banking. The Act of 1850 prohibited banks other than those incorporated
by Parliament or royal charter from issuing notes. It also provided for
a deposit with the government to be held as a guarantee; also for bank
statistics. Further provisions designed to place banking on a more
secure footing were incorporated in the Act of 1871. Further banking
legislation was passed in 1881 and in 1890. <b>Index</b>: <b>Sy</b> Sydenham's plans

<p><b>Baptist Church.</b> Like several other religious denominations in Canada, it
had its origin in Nova Scotia. Some Baptists were living in Lunenburg as
early as 1753. In 1800 the first Baptist Association was formed at
Granville, Nova Scotia, and by 1850 there were Baptist Associations in
many parts of the province. In 1828 the Nova Scotia Baptist Educational
Society was established. The first church was built in Montreal, 1830;
and in 1834 the Baptist Seminary of New Brunswick was founded at
Fredericton. In 1852 the Baptist Missionary Society of Canada was
established. Since then the Baptists have grown rapidly in all the
provinces, and several Baptist colleges and institutions have been
established, notably Acadia and McMaster Universities (<i>q.v.</i>). The
Baptist Church was organized in British Columbia in 1877. <b>Index</b>: <b>W</b> First

east of Kamchatka, and examine the American coast. After a three-years'
journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> overland, reached the eastern coast of Siberia, built vessels
there, and in 1728 followed the coast north to the Arctic, proving that
Asia and America were not united. In 1733 set out again on the long
overland journey, hampered with a huge retinue, and it was not until

<p><b>Bering Sea Question.</b> Arose out of a dispute as to the seal-fisheries of
Bering Sea. Several Canadian sealers were seized by the United States in
1886, on the plea that these waters constituted a <i>mare clausum</i>, or
closed sea. Similar seizures were made in 1887 and 1889. Finally the
British and United States governments agreed to submit the question to
arbitration. The Commission met at Paris in 1893. Lord Hannen and Sir
John Thompson represented British interests; the United States was
represented by Judge Harlan and Senator Morgan. The other arbitrators
were Marquis Visconti Venosta of Italy, Gregora W. Gram of Sweden, and
Baron de Courcel of Belgium, who presided. The decision was in favour of
Great Britain, and contrary to the claim of the United States to
jurisdiction over the waters of the Bering Sea and the seals visiting
the coasts and islands of Alaska. Regulations were provided for the
better protection of the fisheries; and the United States was required
to compensate the Canadian sealers for the unlawful seizure of their
vessels. <b>Index</b>: <b>D</b> Influenced by Russian occupation, 38; settled under

effect: The British Isles were in a state of blockade; intercourse with
them was prohibited; all British subjects within French authority were
to be held as prisoners of war; all British property, private and
public, was declared to be prize of war; also merchandise from Britain;
merchants whose property had been captured by British cruisers were to
be indemnified from the product of such seizures; no British ships were
to be admitted into any port of France, or her allies; every vessel
eluding this rule was to be confiscated. The object of the decrees was
to close the continent against British commerce. The British government
retaliated by issuing an order-in-council, refusing to neutrals the
right of trading from one hostile port to another. <b>Index</b>: <b>Bk</b> Directed by

Poutrincourt and his son Biencourt were far from cordial; little or no
progress was made with the conversion of the Micmacs; and in 1613 Biard

somewhat unwillingly, brought with him to Acadia in 1611 the Jesuits
Biard and Masse. While absent from Port Royal, the fort was attacked and
burnt by Argall in 1613. Biencourt partially rebuilt Port Royal, and was
still there in 1618. Returned to France some time before 1621, and

Royal that he determined to make it his home. De Monts made him a grant
of the lands about Annapolis Basin, which the king confirmed. Went back
to France and brought out his family to the new settlement. Accompanied
Champlain in his exploration of the Bay of Fundy. Jesuit missionaries
were sent out to Port Royal, whom Poutrincourt, although a good Roman
Catholic, found far from congenial. Their relations became more and more
strained, and when Poutrincourt sailed to France in 1613, the Jesuits
succeeded in having him thrown into prison. Regained his liberty and
returned to Acadia, but found Port Royal in ashes. Returned to France
and fell in the attack on Méry. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Goes with De Monts to Acadia,

Arrived at Louisbourg in 1739. After the capture of Louisbourg in 1745,
returned to France, where serious charges of misappropriating public
funds had been brought against him, but his influence at court was still
powerful enough to extricate him from this scrape, and to secure him the
office of intendant of New France, 1748. Sailed for Quebec and arrived
the same year. There elaborated a system of peculation, by which every
branch of the public service was laid under tribute to enrich himself
and his creatures, helping thereby to bring about the final loss of the
colony. Returned to France after the conquest of Canada; thrown into the
Bastille, and released only to be banished from France. <b>Index</b>: <b>WM</b>

<p><b>British North America Act.</b> The constitution of the Dominion; the Act by
which the scattered colonies of British North America were united in one
Confederation. Drafted at the Quebec Conference, 1864; discussed and
passed in the form of resolutions, in the Legislature of Canada, 1865;
put in final shape at the Westminster Conference, 1866; passed by the
Imperial Parliament, and proclaimed, 1867. The essential feature of this
Act, and that which distinguishes it most clearly from the Constitution
of the United States, is the provision that all matters not specifically
assigned to the provinces belong to the Dominion, the reverse being the
case under the United States Constitution. Broadly speaking, the Act
gives the Dominion exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of trade
and commerce, the postal service, customs and inland revenue, military
and naval service, navigation and shipping, currency and coinage,
banking, weights and measures, patents and copyrights, naturalization,
Indians. To the provinces it gives exclusive jurisdiction over direct
taxation, management and sale of public lands, timber, provincial
prisons, hospitals, asylums, etc., municipal institutions,
administration of justice, education. <b>Index</b>: <b>Md</b> Conference in

March 28, 1476, and at that time had been a resident of the city for
fifteen years. Went to England, and in 1497, under the direct authority
of Henry VII, sailed to the westward on a voyage of discovery. Landed on
the shores of America, but his exact landfall has been a moot point. It
is now generally believed that it was the easternmost cape of Cape
Breton. The following year sailed again, but there is no record that he
ever returned from this second voyage. <b>Bib.</b>: Beazley, <i>John and

<p><b>Canadian Contingents in the Boer War</b> (1899-1902). Consisted of the Royal
Canadian Infantry, Canadian Mounted Rifles, Royal Canadian Artillery,
and Strathcona's Horse. The first contingent, which sailed for South
Africa from Quebec, Oct. 30, 1899, numbered 1141. The second contingent,
which sailed from Halifax in January and February, 1900, mustered 1320.
These two contingents comprised the official Canadian contribution to
the British forces in the war, but Lord Strathcona also raised a
contingent at his own expense. This contingent, known as Strathcona's
Horse, sailed from Halifax in March, 1900, the force numbering 540
officers and men, and 599 horses. Over 3000 Canadians therefore took
part in the war against the Boers. Throughout the operations in South
Africa, the Canadians signally distinguished themselves, particularly at
the battle of Paardeberg on Feb. 27, 1900, when with the Gordon
Highlanders and the Shropshires they led the final attack on Cronje's
position. <b>Bib.</b>: Evans, <i>The Canadian Contingents</i>; Marquis, <i>Canada's

engineers, and architects practising in and about Toronto. A royal
charter was granted Nov. 4, 1851, in which the objects of the society
are declared to be "the encouragement and general advancement of the
physical sciences, the arts and the manufactures," etc. Among the early
presidents were Sir W. E. Logan, Sir Henry Lefroy, Sir John Beverley
Robinson, George W. Allan, W. H. Draper, Sir Daniel Wilson, and Sir
Oliver Mowat. The publications of the Institute began with the <i>Canadian

<p><b>Canadian Magazines.</b> Among the earliest magazines published in what is
now Canada were the <i>Nova Scotia Magazine</i>, Halifax, 1789; the <i>Quebec

the <i>Canadian Review</i>, 1824-1826; the <i>Bibliothéque Canadienne</i>,
Montreal, 1825; <i>Literary Garland</i>, Montreal, 1838; <i>Acadian Magazine</i>,
Halifax, 1826; and the <i>Revue Canadienne</i>, 1845. There have been several
periodicals bearing the name of <i>Canadian Magazine</i>, the earliest
published at Montreal in 1823; a second published at Toronto in 1833;
another at Toronto, 1871; and the present periodical of the same name,
which dates from 1893. Of the earlier magazines, the <i>Literary Garland</i>
and the <i>Revue Canadienne</i> alone lived for any considerable time, the
former having been published for over thirteen years, and the latter
still survives. <b>Bib.</b>: Hopkins, <i>Canada: An Ency.</i>, vol. 5.</p>

<p><b>Canadian Northern Railway.</b> The first link in this transcontinental
railway dates back to 1896, when construction was commenced on the line
from Gladstone towards Lake Winnipegosis. Since then the system has been
extended east and west, and within a few years will reach from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, with numerous branches. <b>Bib.</b>: <i>Historical

<p><b>Canadian Pacific Railway.</b> The contract for construction of the railway
was signed Oct. 21, 1880, the surveys having already been carried out
under the direction of Sandford Fleming. Work was begun on the railway
in May, 1881, and the last spike driven by Sir Donald A. Smith (now Lord
Strathcona), Nov. 7, 1885. A summary of the evolution of the project

<p><b>Canals.</b> The earliest canal in Canada and in North America was that at
Lachine, which dates back to the beginning of the eighteenth century.
Between 1779 and 1783, lock canals were built by the Royal Engineers, at
the Coteau and the Cascades, on the St. Lawrence. In 1798 a boat canal
was built at Sault Ste. Marie by the North West Company. A canal to
connect the St. Lawrence and Lake Champlain was advocated as early as
1775, by Silas Deane of Connecticut, but was not actually undertaken
until 1831. The Welland Canal was commenced in 1824; and the Rideau
Canal two years later. These artificial waterways of Canada are
controlled by the Department of Railways and Canals, of the Dominion
government. <b>Index</b>: <b>Bk</b> First in American continent made in Canada, 48. <b>BL</b>

for some years in the service of the king of France, and after the peace
of the Pyrenees, was regularly incorporated in the French army. Fought
against the Turks in 1664, and ordered to America the following year.
With the original regiment was incorporated the fragment of a regiment

<p><b>Cartier, Jacques</b> (1491-1557). In 1534, sailing out of St. Malo, made his
first voyage to the New World, entering the Gulf of St. Lawrence by way
of the Straits of Belle Isle, landing on the Gaspé shore, and coasting
around the eastern end of Anticosti. Returned to France. The following
year again sailed to the gulf, and entered the river St. Lawrence.
Continuing his voyage, passed the mouth of the Saguenay, and landed on
the Island of Orleans, which he named Île Bacchus. Brought his little
ships into the St. Charles River, upon whose banks stood the Indian
village of Stadaconé. After exploring the St. Lawrence as far as the
Indian town of Hochelaga (Montreal), returned to Stadaconé, where he
wintered. In the spring of 1536 sailed back to France, taking with him
the Iroquois chief, Donnacona. In 1541, made a third voyage to Canada.
Roberval was to have followed with a number of colonists, but did not
actually sail until the spring of 1542. When he reached Newfoundland, he
met Cartier on his way home. Roberval's colony proved disastrous, and
Cartier undertook a fourth voyage to the New World to rescue the
survivors. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Names Hare Island, 13; ravages of scurvy among his

<p><b>Chabanel, Noél.</b> Jesuit missionary in the Huron country, 1643. Had been a
professor of rhetoric in France, before coming to Canada. When the
Hurons were driven from their country by the Iroquois, in 1649, he and
Garnier led their demoralized flock to the Island of St. Joseph, in
Matchadash Bay, an inlet of Georgian Bay. Even here the Iroquois
followed them, and attacked the mission of St. Jean, Dec. 7, 1649.
Chabanel had left the place a short time before, and so escaped the
general massacre. He, however, fell a victim to one of his own Hurons,
who confessed that he had murdered the missionary and thrown his body
into a river. <b>Index</b>: <b>L</b> Died a martyr, 62. <b>Bib.</b>: Parkman, <i>Jesuits in

<p><b>Champlain Lake.</b> Discovered by Samuel Champlain, July, 1609. Here took
place the first hostile encounter between the French and the Iroquois.
The French were the aggressors, and had bitter enough cause to remember
the fact throughout the century. In 1666 the Sieur de la Motte built a
fort on Île La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> Motte, which was afterwards abandoned. Fort St. Frederic
was built at Crown Point, 1731. It was enlarged and strengthened in
1734, and again in 1742. Lake Champlain became the war thoroughfare, not
merely between the Iroquois and French, but between New France and New
England. Fort Carillon was built, 1755-1756. With this lake are
associated the names of Dieskau and Sir William Johnson, Montcalm and
Abercrombie, Ethan Allen and Montgomery. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Champlain reaches, in

<p><b>Châteauguay.</b> Battle in War of 1812, Oct. 26, 1813. The stream from which
the battle took its name, rises in Franklin County, New York, and falls
into the St. Lawrence a few miles above Caughnawaga. The scene of the
battle was about six miles above the confluence of the English with
Châteauguay River. Hampton was in command of the Americans, and De
Salaberry commanded the Canadian troops, with Colonel Macdonell in
charge of the reserves. Although the former had an overwhelmingly
superior force, the result of the battle was in favour of the Canadians;
and the contemplated attack on Montreal was abandoned. The battle was
won by French-Canadian militia under a French-Canadian commander. <i>See

<p><b>Chatham, William Pitt, first Earl of</b> (1708-1778). The "Great Commoner,"
who brought England "to a height of prosperity and glory unknown to any
former age." He urged continually a conciliatory policy towards America,
until it became apparent that the colonists would be satisfied with
nothing less than independence. His broad outlook and unerring instinct
in the choice of men were chiefly responsible for the triumphs of
British policy at home and abroad. Sent Boscawen and Amherst to the
capture of Louisbourg, and Wolfe and Saunders to victory at Quebec.

<p><b>Church of England.</b> The first Anglican church in what is now Canada was
built at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1750, when Cornwallis was governor of
the province. The first see was established in 1787. Dr. Charles Inglis
as bishop of Nova Scotia had charge of the whole of British North
America. The first service held in Quebec was in the Ursuline Convent,
September, 1759. The first Anglican bishop of the diocese of Quebec was
Dr. Mountain, appointed in 1793; and in 1839 Dr. John Strachan became
first bishop of Toronto. As population grew, the eastern dioceses were
subdivided into nine. The see of Rupert's Land, founded 1849, was
subsequently divided into Rupert's Land, Moosonee, Saskatchewan,
Calgary, Mackenzie River, Qu'Appelle, Athabaska, Keewatin, and Selkirk.
In 1859 was established the see of British Columbia, divided later into
New Westminster and Caledonia. In 1857 the Church of England Synod was
legally constituted; and after that year bishops were elected by the
votes of clergy and laity in Canada. The first Church Congress was held,
1883. The General Synod of the Church in the Dominion was established,
1893, and the metropolitans of Canada and Rupert's Land were made
archbishops, the first of whom were Dr. J.T. Lewis and Dr. R. Machray.

the St. Lawrence, in return for which the Company was to take out three
hundred colonists every year up to 1643. No serious effort was made to

<p><b>Company of Rouen and St. Malo (Champlain's Company).</b> Established at the
instance of Champlain, in 1614. The shares were divided among the
merchants of Rouen and St. Malo. The terms of their charter required the
Company to bring out colonists, but as usual they did not take this
obligation very seriously. They did, however, make one notable addition
to the population of New France, for in the spring of 1617 they brought
out Louis Hébert and his family. Hébert's experience as a colonist was
not such as to encourage others to follow his example. The Company's
monopoly was cancelled in 1620. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Formed by Champlain, 122; its

<p><b>Company of the West Indies (Compagnie des Indes Occidentales).</b> Chartered
by Louis XIV, 1664, following the cancellation of the charter of the
Company of New France. Its field of operations was enormous, covering
the west coast of Africa, the east coast of South America from the
Amazon to the Orinoco, Canada, Acadia, and Newfoundland. The
Christianization of the native tribes was given as the principal object
of the Company, commerce being of only secondary importance. Despite its
many privileges, and the readiness with which its stock was subscribed,
it did not prosper, and by 1672 was hopelessly in debt. Three years
later its charter was revoked, so far as Canada was concerned. <b>Index</b>: <b>L</b>

<p><b>Confederation.</b> The first definite step in the movement looking towards
the union of the British North American colonies, was the Charlottetown
Conference, 1864. Delegates from the three Maritime Provinces met to
consider the union of those provinces. At the Conference, delegates from
Canada (constituting what are now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec)
appeared, and urged the broadening of the discussion to cover all the
provinces. Out of this meeting grew the Quebec Conference, of the same
year, attended by delegates from Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland; the two latter subsequently
withdrew from the movement. The Quebec Conference drew up a series of
resolutions, which were made the basis of the final legislation. In 1866
delegates from the provinces met at the Westminster Hotel in London, and
framed the British North America Act. The Act was passed by the Imperial
Parliament, and received the queen's assent, March, 1867. It was
proclaimed throughout the new Dominion of Canada, July 1, 1867. Manitoba
was created a province, July 15, 1870. British Columbia joined the
union, July 20, 1871; and Prince Edward Island, July 1, 1873. The
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created Sept. 1, 1905. <b>Index</b>:

ocean shipping. Watched closely the early attempts to cross the Atlantic
by steam, and when in 1838 the British government invited tenders for

sailed for England and laid before the Admiralty his carefully-matured
plans for a line of steamships. Succeeded in enlisting the support of
several big shipping firms in England, and had no difficulty in securing
the contract. So originated the Cunard company, which from an initial
fleet of four vessels of 1200 tons each and 440 horse-power has grown to
its present gigantic proportions. Was one of the owners of the <i>Royal
William</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). Made a baronet, 1859. <b>Index</b>: <b>H</b> Establishes steamship

situation owing to the condition to which the country had been brought
by the failure of La Barre and the intrigues of the English governor of
New York. Adopted a severe policy with the Indians, and was condemned
for his treacherous seizure of Iroquois at Fort Frontenac in 1687. The
horrible massacre of Lachine was one of the consequences of his
maladministration. Succeeded in the government of the colony by

after made one of the lieutenants of Acadia under the Company of New
France, and settled at Miscou. In 1647 his fort seized by D'Aulnay, who
had just been made lieutenant-general of the colony. In 1650 his
establishment in Cape Breton captured and he himself taken prisoner. A
second attempt to settle in Cape Breton frustrated by Le Borgne.
Returned to France in 1653, and received a grant of the islands of the
St. Lawrence, including a monopoly of the fur trade, and shortly after
became governor of that territory, together with Newfoundland. In 1667
obtained a confirmation of his rights, but in the winter of 1668-1669
his establishment at St. Peters completely destroyed by fire. In 1671
returned to France and engaged in the preparation of his work on Acadia.
About 1685 returned to Acadia, but his closing years darkened by the
scattering of his vast estates. Died three years later, at the age of 90

<p><b>Dollard des Ormeaux, Adam.</b> A young officer of the garrison at Montreal,
who saved Montreal and the colony from probable destruction by the
Iroquois, in 1660. With sixteen companions and a few Indian allies, he
intercepted the Iroquois at the Long Sault Rapids, on the Ottawa, and
with a heroism seldom equalled in the world's history, this little band
gave their lives for their country's sake. The Iroquois, discouraged by
such unexpected resistance, abandoned the projected raid on the colony.

<p><b>Draper, William Henry</b> (1801-1877). Born in London, England. In his youth
ran away to sea and served on an East Indiaman. Came to Canada in 1821
and taught school at Port Hope; subsequently studied law and began
practice at York. Elected to Assembly of Upper Canada for city of
Toronto in 1836, and made a member of the Executive Council. During the
Rebellion of 1837 acted as aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-governor. In
March, 1837, became solicitor-general, and in 1840 promoted to office of
attorney-general. After the union of the provinces retained in the
Executive Council as attorney-general of Upper Canada. It fell to his
lot to pilot the ministry through the stormy debates of the first
session, and to resist the attacks of Baldwin, Hincks, and their
fellow-Reformers. In September, 1842, saw the necessity of resigning and
gave way in order that the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry might be formed.
In 1843 appointed to the Legislative Council, where he led the
opposition. On the resignation of the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry in
December, 1843, accepted office with Viger, and in the exciting election
held in the autumn of 1844 obtained a bare majority for the new
ministry. In January, 1845, resigned his seat in the Legislative Council
and elected to the Assembly for London. An unsuccessful attempt to
secure the support of the French-Canadian Reform section discredited him
with the Tories of Upper Canada, and in May, 1847, withdrew from the
Cabinet, and shortly afterwards resigned his seat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> the Assembly.
Appointed puisne judge of the Court of Queen's Bench for Upper Canada,
and in 1856 made chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas. In July,
1863, succeeded Archibald McLean as chief justice of Upper Canada, and

and, having acquired considerable wealth, remained in the colony after
the conquest. In 1764 made a magistrate and justice of the peace.
Vigorously opposed an ordinance of 1770 regulating the administration of
justice, and on several subsequent occasions clashed with the executive
authority. Suspected by Haldimand of having been in secret
correspondence with the United States, and arrested in September, 1780;
from November, 1780, to May, 1783, kept in confinement without the
opportunity of a legal trial. In 1784 went to England, where he
denounced Haldimand and sought redress before the British ministry. In
this connection published an "<i>Appel à la Justice de l'État</i>," setting
forth his personal grievances, but concluding with a carefully prepared
plan of government, which was considered as the basis for that adopted
in the Constitutional Act of 1791. Complaints were not favourably
received, and returned to Canada. In March, 1786, left New York for
London on board the <i>Shelburne</i>, which is supposed to have been lost

<p><b>Duquesne de Menneville, Michel Ange, Marquis de.</b> Appointed governor of
New France 1752, in succession to La Jonquière. His policy was to
intercept communication between New England and the western Indians and
thus to restore the Indians to dependence on France. In the spring of
1753 sent a force of a thousand men under Morin to the Ohio district; a
fort was built at Presque Isle and another, Fort Le B&oelig;uf, inland on
River Le B&oelig;uf. Disease made ravages among the troops, and while 300
were left to garrison the forts, the remainder were compelled to return
to Montreal, and Duquesne's plans for a further advance were frustrated.
Nevertheless the Indians were brought into submission to the French.
Improved the organization of the government of the colony, and through
thorough discipline raised the efficiency of the colonial troops.

<p><b>Durham, John George Lambton, Earl of</b> (1792-1840). Entered British
Parliament, 1814, for county of Durham, and won recognition as an
advanced Reformer. Brought forward plan of parliamentary reform in 1821.
Raised to peerage, 1828. Member of Grey's ministry, 1830. Sent to St.
Petersburg on special mission, 1833. Ambassador to Russia, 1836. Sent to
Canada in 1838 to bring order out of the chaos of the Rebellion. His
famous Report followed. His policy in Canada excited much opposition
both in Great Britain and Canada. The House of Lords voted disapproval
of some of his acts, and he took the extraordinary step of returning to
England without either being recalled or obtaining the royal consent.
Nevertheless the wisdom of his recommendations has since been abundantly
justified. Died at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, soon after his return.

<p><b>Earthquake of 1663.</b> Known in Canadian history as the "Great Earthquake."
The most extravagant accounts have come down as to the circumstances
attending this earthquake, but it was undoubtedly the most serious
disturbance of the earth's crust, in Canadian territory, of which we
have any record. It affected chiefly the valley of the St. Lawrence from
Montreal to the gulf, a region more susceptible to seismic disturbance
than any other in Eastern Canada. Kingsford cites contemporary reports
of similar phenomena in 1638 and 1766. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Described by Avaugour,

<p><b>Fenian Raids.</b> The Fenian Brotherhood is said to have been formed about
1858 in Ireland and the United States, the object being to liberate
Ireland from its connection with England, and establish a republic. A
history of the movement in Ireland will be found in McCarthy's <i>History
of our Own Times</i>, and in O'Leary's <i>Recollections of Fenianism</i>. Early
in 1866 the American branch of the Brotherhood planned an invasion of
Canada. The Canadian militia was called out, but the invasion was
postponed. In April, the New Brunswick border was threatened, and troops
marched to the defence of St. Andrews and St. Stephen. The Fenians
thought better of it. Late in May another party, under one O'Neil,
crossed from Buffalo to Fort Erie and advanced to Ridgeway, where they
were driven back. In 1870 the same O'Neil led his followers into Quebec,
but was again repulsed. In 1871 he made a similar attempt in the West,
but a detachment of United States troops from Fort Pembina followed,
arrested him, and dispersed his followers. An aftermath of the earlier
Fenian Raids was the murder of Thomas D'Arcy McGee (<i>q.v.</i>) in Ottawa,

<p><b>Geological Survey.</b> First suggested by Dr. Rae, in 1832. W. E.
(afterwards <i>Sir</i>) Logan was appointed provincial geologist, 1842, and,
the government having decided to carry out a geological survey of the
province, he took charge of the work the following year. The
establishment of the survey was largely the result of petitions
presented by the Natural History Society of Montreal, and the Quebec
Literary and Historical Society. The first report was for the year 1843.
Twenty years later, the reports 1843-1863 were summarized in a volume of
983 pages, <i>Geology of Canada</i>. The periods 1863-1866 and 1866-1869 were
each covered in a single report. Thereafter, annual volumes were
published. Two general indexes have been issued, one for the reports
1863-1884, and the second for 1885-1906.</p>

native country after the battle of Culloden in 1746, and emigrated to
America. They were all intensely loyal, and when the Revolution broke
out many moved north into Canada, settling on the Niagara frontier, the
bay of Quinté, and the banks of the St. Lawrence. From the latter
settlement sprang the present Glengarry County. In 1804-1805 Bishop
McDonell obtained several grants of land in the district for the
Highlanders of the disbanded Scottish Glengarry Regiment, and for
twenty-five years promoted the interests of the colonists. He raised, in
1812, the Glengarry Fencibles Regiment, which rendered valuable service

<p><b>Gourlay, Robert Fleming</b> (1778-1863). Born in the parish of Ceres,
Fifeshire, Scotland. Attended St. Andrews University. Took part in an
inquiry into the condition of the poor in Great Britain, and carried on
an aggressive agitation for a reform of the poor laws. Came to Canada,
1817, and settled at Kingston. Becoming convinced of the need of radical
changes in the land system of Upper Canada, attacked the administration
with so much energy that he was finally, after a grossly unfair trial,
expelled from the province. Returning to Scotland, devoted himself to
the preparation of his work on Upper Canada; lost most of his property
as the result of lawsuits; and imprisoned for a personal attack on Lord
Brougham in the lobby of the House of Commons. On his release, visited
the United States about 1836, and instrumental in dissuading Ohio
sympathizers from joining the movement under William Lyon Mackenzie. In
1842 his case brought before the Legislature of Upper Canada, and the
House decided that his arrest had been "illegal, unconstitutional and
without possibility of excuse and palliation, and the sentence declared
null and void." Did not, however, return to Canada until 1856, when he
was granted a pension of fifty pounds; this he refused because he
considered that his vindication had not been complete. Contested Oxford
County in 1860, but defeated; returned to Edinburgh, where he died.

<p><b>Grand Portage.</b> Near western end of Lake Superior, about twenty miles

places, it is impossible to say who was the first white man to stand
upon this famous centre of the fur trade. Radisson came this way in
1662; Du Lhut in 1678; Noyon in 1688; La Noüe in 1717; but there is no
evidence that any of the four were actually at Grand Portage. It is
first mentioned in a memoir by Pachot, 1722; and the earliest
authenticated visit to the spot is that of La Vérendrye, 1731. From that
time it grew steadily in importance until finally abandoned, 1801, in
favour of Fort William. The name was applied both to the trading-post on
the shore of Lake Superior, and to the portage thence to the Pigeon
River. <b>Index</b>: <b>MS</b> Described, 13; the portage, 13; as it is to-day, 13; in

<p><b>Hudson's Bay Company.</b> Organized by a number of English gentlemen, who
sent out a trading expedition to Hudson Bay, in the <i>Nonsuch</i>, in 1668.
This initial venture proved so successful that two other ships were sent
out in 1670; and the same year King Charles granted a charter
incorporating them as "The Governor and Company of Adventurers of
England trading into Hudson's Bay." For many years the operations of the
Company were confined to the shores of Hudson Bay, but the pressure of
competition eventually forced them inland, and at the height of their
power they had established trading-posts from Labrador to the Pacific,
and from California almost to the Arctic. In 1821, the rival North West
Company (<i>q.v.</i>) was absorbed; and in 1869 the company surrendered to
Canada its territorial rights in British North America. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> 203;

<p><b>Huron Indians.</b> Name applied by the French to a confederacy of four
Iroquoian tribes. When French missionaries and explorers first went
among them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> they occupied the country about Lake Simcoe and Georgian
Bay. They had been at enmity with the Iroquois for many years, and had
repeatedly ravaged their country. Finally the Iroquois determined to
make an end of the Hurons. They invaded their country in force in 1648,
and in 1650 had destroyed all their villages, killed most of the
inhabitants, and driven the remnant far to the westward. A few of the
Hurons escaped to Quebec, and settled at the mission of Lorette. In the
seventeenth century their population was estimated at from 20,000 to
35,000. In 1905 there remained a total of 832, in Canada and the United
States. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Destruction of, by Iroquois, 26, 35; join Frontenac's

Canada in 1683. Three years later accompanied De Troyes in the
expedition against the English on Hudson Bay, and took part in the
capture of Moose Factory, Fort Rupert, and Albany. Returned to Quebec in
1687; and the following year was again on the bay. In 1689 captured the
<i>Hampshire</i>, and brought her to Quebec with her cargo of furs. In 1690
took part in the raid on Schenectady; and the same year captured Fort
Severn on Hudson Bay. In 1694 sailed to the bay with a French fleet, and
captured Fort Nelson. Two years later captured Pemaquid; and, sailing to
Newfoundland, captured St. John's and raided the villages along the
coast. In 1697 again sailed to Hudson Bay, defeated a superior fleet,
and recaptured Fort Nelson. The following year sailed from Brest in
command of an expedition to discover the mouth of the Mississippi and
plant a colony there, in both of which he was successful. The remaining
years of his life spent in building up the colony of Louisiana. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b>

described by Allouez, Marquette, Hennepin, Rasles, and other early
French explorers. Harassed on one side by the Sioux and Foxes, and on
the other by the Iroquois, their numbers were reduced from six or eight
thousand, at the end of the seventeenth century, to less than two
thousand about 1750. The murder of Pontiac by one of their warriors
brought upon them a war of extermination. To-day only a handful remain,
in Oklahoma. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Allies of the French against the Iroquois, 144. <b>L</b>

<p><b>Imperial Conference.</b> Held in London, 1887. Canada was represented by Sir
Alexander Campbell and Sandford Fleming. Among the questions discussed
were those of inter-Imperial defence and trade, the Pacific cable, etc.
Another conference was held in Ottawa in 1894 (<i>see</i> Colonial
Conference, 1894); and another in London in June, 1896, Canada being
represented by Sir Mac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>kenzie Bowell and Sandford Fleming. At an
adjourned meeting in October, 1896, Sir Donald Smith and Hon. A.G. Jones
represented the Dominion, Mr. Fleming being present in an advisory
capacity. On the occasion of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, 1897,
another conference was held in London, Joseph Chamberlain presiding, and
the self-governing colonies being represented by their premiers. Again,
in 1902, the colonial premiers met in London, under the presidency of
Joseph Chamberlain. The London Conference of 1907, presided over by Lord
Elgin, discussed various Imperial questions, but was chiefly memorable
because of the decision to hold similar meetings every four years, and
to provide a permanent bureau at London devoted specifically to the
interests of the Empire.</p>

<p><b>Imperial Federation.</b> Advocated by Thomas Pownall, governor of
Massachusetts Bay, in 1764. He proposed a scheme by which "Great Britain
may be no more considered as the Kingdom of this Isle alone, with many
appendages of provinces, colonies, settlements, and other extraneous
parts, but as a grand marine dominion, consisting of our possessions in
the Atlantic and in America united into one Empire." Subsequently
proposed by Joseph Howe, in 1855, and again in 1863; also by Thomas
Chandler Haliburton and other Canadian statesmen and writers. <b>Index</b>: <b>B</b>

of his episcopate was his establishment of King's College, Windsor. In

<p><b>Institut Canadien.</b> A literary and scientific society, founded at

members most of the leaders of the more progressive and independent
element in Quebec political life, among them A. A. Dorion, Eric Dorion,
Joseph Doutre, Rodolphe Laflamme, and Wilfrid Laurier. The success of
the parent society led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> founding of similar Instituts throughout
the province. Although popular among the laity, these societies
encountered the determined opposition of the Roman Catholic Church, led
by Bishop Bourget of Montreal. The outside societies yielded to clerical
pressure, but the Montreal Institut stood upon its rights. The fight
went on for many years, but finally most of the Roman Catholic members
dropped out, and the books and papers were transferred to the Fraser
Institute. <b>Bib.</b>: Willison, <i>Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberal Party</i>.</p>

<p><b>Intendant.</b> An office created originally by Richelieu, in France, and
transferred to New France. The first intendant of Canada was Robert,
appointed in 1663, who was succeeded two years later by the ablest
occupant of the office, Jean Talon. The intendant was charged with the
supervision of practically all the civil affairs of the colony,
including the administration of justice, but his most important
function, from the point of view of the court, was to act as a virtual
spy upon the acts of the governor. Inevitably, harmony was impossible
between these two officials, and the history of New France is punctuated
with their perpetual quarrels. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Jean Talon appointed as, 51;

<p><b>Intercolonial Railway.</b> Surveys proposed by the government of Canada in
1863. Three engineers were to be appointed, one by the Imperial
government, one by Canada, and one by the Maritime Provinces. They all
nominated the same man, Sandford Fleming, by whom the surveys were
accordingly carried out. The railway was made a condition of the union
of the Maritime Provinces with Canada, and the work of construction was
pushed forward, the line being formally opened July 1, 1876. In 1871 the
Prince Edward Island Railway was begun, and in 1873 it became a portion
of the Intercolonial system. Other extensions and branches were built or
acquired, the line finally running from Sydney and Halifax to Montreal.

<p><b>Iroquois.</b> A confederation of tribes, at first five, the Cayuga, Mohawk,
Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca, to which the Tuscarora was added after
1726, as well as the remnants of many other tribes. They were known to
the English colonists as the Five Nations, and later as the Six Nations.
They called themselves <i>Oñgwanonsioñni</i>, "we are of the extended lodge."
When they first came into contact with Europeans, they occupied the
country between Lake Champlain and the Genesee River, and this remained
their home territory, but they ranged far and wide, carrying their
conquering raids eastwards to the Kennebec, westwards to Lake Michigan,
north to the Hudson Bay watershed, and south to the Tennessee. They
numbered about 16,000 in 1677, and after dropping to 10,000 in the next
century, they returned to their original strength at the opening of the
twentieth century. About two-thirds are on reservations in Canada; the

<p><b>Jesuits' Estates Act.</b> Passed by the Mercier government in Quebec, 1888.
Following the suppression of the Society of Jesus by the pope, in 1773,
the property of the order in Canada became vested in the crown, and was
set apart for purposes of education in the province of Quebec. By the
British North America Act, it was vested in the provincial government.
The Mercier Act authorized payment of $400,000 as compensation to the
Jesuits for the lands confiscated by the crown. An agitation in Ontario
for disallowance of the Act, was followed by a formal motion in the
Dominion House, by Colonel O'Brien, but only thirteen members voted for
disallowance. <b>Index</b>: <b>Md</b> Origin, 286; claimed by Society of Jesus, 286;

Hamilton. In 1673 set out with Jacques Marquette (<i>q.v.</i>) to discover
the Mississippi. Leaving Michilimackinac on May 17, they coasted the
north shore of Lake Michigan, to the foot of Green Bay, ascended Fox
River to Lake Winnebago, and descended the Wisconsin to the Mississippi,
which they reached a month after leaving Michilimackinac. Descended the
great river, passing the mouths of the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, and
Arkansas, and turned back from a village of the Arkansas Indians on July
17; returning to Lake Michigan by way of the Illinois. Jolliet was
unfortunate enough to lose the records of his journey at the foot of the
Lachine rapids, almost within sight of Montreal. Made a journey to
Hudson Bay in 1679; and the following year received a grant of the
Island of Anticosti, where he settled with his family. In 1694 explored
the coast of Labrador. On his return made royal pilot for the St.
Lawrence, and hydrographer of the colony. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Discoverer of

<p><b>Labrador.</b> The name has been popularly applied to the whole territory
bounded by the Atlantic, Hudson Strait, and Hudson Bay, which includes
not only the Labrador coast-strip, but also a portion of the North-West
Territories. Also known at one time as New Britain. The name is properly
applied to the strip of coast from Cape Chidley to Blanc Sablon, forming
a dependency of the colony of Newfoundland. On various theories as to
origin of name, <i>see</i> Ganong, <i>Cartography of Gulf of St. Lawrence</i> (R.
S. C., 1889). The boundaries have long been in dispute between
Newfoundland and Canada, and the territory has several times changed
hands. The Labrador coast was first discovered by the Northmen, in the
tenth century. Cabot sailed along the coast in 1498, and Corte-Real in
1500. The interior remained practically unexplored till traversed by
officers of the Hudson's Bay Company about 1840. There are a few posts
of the Hudson's Bay Company on the coast. The southern portion is
inhabited by a primitive race of fishermen; in the north are several
missions of the Moravian Brethren, first established there in 1764.

war. Governor of Canada, 1749-1752. His administration marked by nothing
that would further the welfare of the colony; but rather by a determined
effort to enrich himself at the expense of the country. <b>Bib.</b>: Parkman,

<p><b>Lake Champlain.</b> <i>See</i> Champlain, Lake.</p>

<p><b>Lake George.</b> South of Lake Champlain. This beautiful lake was known to
the Indians as Horicon, and to the French as Lac St. Sacrament. The
outlet of the lake, after circling through the forest and passing over a
series of leaps in the falls of Ticonderoga, flows nearly two miles and
enters Lake Champlain just above Fort George. Lying on the recognized
thoroughfare, north and south, this lake has been the scene of many
memorable conflicts, in the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> and colonial wars. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b>

Probably discovered by Jacques De Noyon, about the year 1688. Fort St.
Charles was built by La Vérendrye, on the western shore of the lake, in
1732. His son Jean, with the Jesuit missionary Aulneau, and a number of
voyageurs, were murdered by the Sioux on an island in the lake, in 1736.
In addition to its present name, which is a translation of the name
given it by the French, Lac des Bois, it has also borne several other
names, Lac des Sioux, Lac des Isles, Lake of the Sandhills, etc.</p>

Galinée upon the first of those explorations towards the west and south
for which he was to become famous. Meeting Jolliet at the western end of
Lake Ontario, Dollier de Casson and Galinée decided to make their way to
the upper lakes, while La Salle turned south and explored the Ohio. His
later explorations have been the subject of long controversy&mdash;the point
in dispute being whether he explored the Mississippi before or after
Marquette and Jolliet. In any event, he first descended the river to its
mouth, 1681-1682. Upon his return, sailed for France, and in 1684 set
out with four ships to establish a colony at the mouth of the
Mississippi. This unfortunate expedition culminated in the murder of La

<p><b>La Tour, Charles Amador de.</b> Son of Claude de la Tour. Came to Acadia in
1610 with his father. Driven out of Port Royal by the English; built a
post near Cape Sable, on what is now known as Port Latour. In 1632, when
Acadia was restored to France, Razilly came out with Charnisay to
strengthen the colony. Razilly died in 1636, and a bitter conflict
followed between Charnisay and La Tour, both of whom claimed to
represent the king in Acadia. Charnisay had rebuilt Port Royal, and La
Tour occupied a fort at the mouth of the St. John. The outcome of the
quarrel was an order for the arrest of La Tour. Charnisay attacked La
Tour's fort, but was driven off. When he blockaded the harbour, La Tour
escaped to Boston, returned with English ships, and drove Charnisay to
the shelter of Port Royal. The latter's opportunity came, however,
later. He attacked the fort during La Tour's absence. La Tour's wife
made a gallant defence, and Charnisay succeeded in the end only by
resorting to treachery. He carried Madame La Tour to Port Royal, where
she died in 1645. Some years later, after the death of Charnisay, La
Tour brought this curious drama to a conclusion by marrying the widow of
his rival. He had already obtained restitution from the king, who made
him governor of Acadia; and some years later showed his powers of
persuasion by obtaining a generous grant of land from Cromwell, who had,
in 1654, taken possession of the colony. Died about 1666. <b>Bib.</b>: Parkman,

<p><b>La Tour, Claude de.</b> A Huguenot gentleman; came to Port Royal in 1610
with Poutrincourt; in 1614 had a trading-post on the Penobscot. Sailed
for France in 1627, and on his return the following year, with supplies
for the defence of Acadia, captured by Kirke and carried to England.
There married one of the queen's French maids of honour, and was
persuaded to throw in his lot with the English. Promised to win over his
son Charles (<i>q.v.</i>), but the latter scornfully refused to change his
allegiance. Afterwards built a fort at the mouth of the St. John, for
the French, to whom he had once more transferred his services. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b>

<p><b>Lauzon, Jean de.</b> Born, 1582. Governor of New France, 1651-1656; had
already been associated with the interests of the colony by reason of
his position as president of the Company of New France, and had used his
office to acquire the island of Montreal and Point Lévis opposite
Quebec. His administration as governor made odious not only by a long
series of public mistakes, but by his too obvious intention of using the
office to enrich himself and his sons. Returned to France in 1656; and
mentioned in contemporary narratives as late as 1660. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b>

the New England campaign of 1704, and the following year in
Newfoundland. In 1707 with the army in Flanders, and wounded at
Malplaquet in 1709. Returning to Canada, engaged in the fur trade, for
some years on the St. Maurice, and 1727-1728 on Lake Nipigon. There
conceived the idea of exploring the unknown country beyond Lake
Superior, to discover the Western Sea, a project to which he devoted the
remainder of his life. Left Montreal for the West in 1731; built forts
on Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods, and in the succeeding years
penetrated to Lake Winnipeg, Red River, and the Assiniboine. In 1738
made a journey to the Mandan villages on the Missouri; and the following
year one of his sons penetrated to the Saskatchewan. In 1742, unable to
go himself, sent two of his sons far to the south-west. They hoped, as
he had always hoped, to reach at last the Western Sea, but were baffled
by hostile tribes and the barrier of the Rocky Mountains. In 1743
returned finally to Montreal, broken in health and heavily in debt. Six
years later died there. His sons begged to be allowed to continue his
western explorations, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> hostile influences made this impossible. <b>WM</b>

but promptly resigned under official pressure, the policy of the
government being opposed to anything approaching popular government.
Raised a company of volunteers at Quebec in 1665, and accompanied the
regulars to Three Rivers, which they were just in time to save from an

<p><b>Libraries.</b> The first public library in Canada was the Quebec library,
founded in 1779 largely through the efforts of Haldimand. After many
vicissitudes, the library was absorbed by the Literary and Historical
Society of Quebec. The first college library was that of the Seminary at
Quebec, 1668; Montreal College library was opened in 1767; and King's
College library in 1790. Legislative libraries were established in each
of the provinces at an early date. In 1841 the libraries of Upper and
Lower Canada were combined, and from this year dates the establishment
of the library of Parliament. The first circulating library in Upper
Canada was founded at Niagara in 1800. Similar libraries existed in
Montreal as early as 1824, and at Kingston in 1836; the Red River
library was founded at Fort Garry in 1847. <b>Index</b>: <b>Hd</b> First in Canada

<p><b>Loyalists, United Empire</b>. Name applied to the inhabitants of the
Thirteen Colonies who remained loyal to Great Britain, and rather than
submit to the new republic, migrated to Canada, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. No adequate provision having been made
for them by the mother country, in the treaty of Paris (1783), the
Loyalists were compelled in most cases to abandon all their worldly
possessions, and start life anew in the pioneer settlements of the
north. May 18, 1783, one great section of the refugees landed at the
mouth of the St. John River, and built a town, first named Parrtown,
later St. John. Other settlements were made, about the same time, at
various points on the coasts of Nova Scotia, as well as on St. John's
Island (Prince Edward Island). The bulk of the migration to what was
then Quebec (now Ontario and Quebec) took place in 1784, the eastern
Loyalists going north by way of Lake Champlain and the Richelieu, and
settling in the Eastern Townships; those of the West crossing the
boundary at Niagara and other points, and spreading throughout the
backbone of the future province of Upper Canada. <b>Index</b>: <b>B</b> Land grants to

<p><b>McGill University.</b> Founded through the far-sighted liberality of James
McGill, a merchant of Montreal, who in his will left his property of
Burnside and £10,000 to found the college. It was granted a royal
charter in 1820, and opened in 1829. The original bequest proving
insufficient to complete the college buildings, a further sum was given
by William Molson for that purpose. A new charter was obtained in 1852.
The period of greatest development of the university dates from 1855,
when J. W. Dawson was appointed principal. The university has been
fortunate in receiving generous bequests from wealthy citizens of
Montreal, notably from Peter Redpath, Sir W. C. Macdonald, and Lord
Strathcona. <b>Bib.</b>: Dawson, <i>Historical Sketch of McGill University</i> in

<p><b>Methodist Church in Canada.</b> Can be traced back to 1772, when a party of
Yorkshire Methodists settled in Nova Scotia. The first provincial
Methodist Conference was held at Halifax in 1786. In 1814 the British
Conference appointed missionaries to Quebec and Montreal; and in 1807
the first Methodist Conference was held at Elizabethtown (Brockville).
In 1828 the Canada Conference became independent of the Methodist
Episcopal Church of the United States; and in 1833 the Canada Methodist
Episcopal Church united with the British Wesleyans. In 1874 the Wesleyan
Methodist Conference of Canada, the Canadian Wesleyan New Connexion
Conference, and the Wesleyan Conference of Eastern British America
became one as the Methodist Church of Canada. The first session of the
General Conference was held the same year. In 1883 the Primitive
Methodist Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church also became part of
the Methodist Church in Canada. <b>Index</b>: <b>R</b> History of church in Canada,

<p><b>Methye Portage.</b> Also known as Portage La Loche. Named after the methye
or loche (<i>Lota maculosa</i>), which has always been abundant in
neighbouring waters. This portage was an important point in the palmy
days of the fur trade. It leads from the Churchill to the Clearwater,
and so to the Athabaska and the immense systems of northern and western
waterways that lie beyond. It was noted for its beautiful scenery, which
has been described or mentioned by Mackenzie, Franklin, Back, and other
northern travellers. It was first crossed by Peter Pond in 1778. The
route has now been abandoned for some years, supplies for the northern
posts of the Hudson's Bay Company being transported overland from
Edmonton to Athabaska Landing, and thence down the Athabaska. <b>Bib.</b>:

northern fastnesses. In 1633 the Jesuits first established missions
among them, and laboured diligently for many years among this most

<p><b>Montreal Company.</b> Founded at Montreal, 1784, in opposition to the North
West Company. Two Montreal merchants, John Gregory and Alexander Norman
McLeod, formed a partnership with Peter Pond and Peter Pangman, western
fur traders. Alexander Mackenzie joined the Company, and much of its
success was due to his energy and resourcefulness. His cousin, Roderick
Mackenzie, was also in its service. Keen rivalry resulted between the
two companies, finally culminating in a tragedy; in the Athabaska
department, Pond, who had deserted to the North West Company, quarrelled
with his rival, Ross, and in the scuffle Ross was fatally shot. This
serious news being brought down to the headquarters at Grand Portage, a
conference was held, resulting in the union of the Companies in 1788.

Company formed by Champlain to plant colonies in New France, and to
which a monopoly of the fur trade had been granted by the king. Had made
the voyage to Tadoussac with Pont-Gravé in 1603, and had conceived no
very high opinion of the St. Lawrence as a field for colonization; it
was therefore decided to direct the operations of the Company to Acadia.
In 1604, with Champlain, sailed to Acadia, explored the Bay of Fundy,
and discovered Annapolis Basin and the St. John River; settlements were
established at Ste. Croix Island and Port Royal; in 1606 returned to
France; and the following year sent Champlain and Pont-Gravé on an
expedition to the St. Lawrence. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Ten years trading patent, with

1612-1613. Captain Luke Foxe spent eleven days at Port Nelson in 1631.
The river itself was explored by David Thompson in 1792. Pierre Radisson
visited the mouth of the river in 1669, and built the first trading-fort
there. In later years the post was repeatedly captured by the French,
and recaptured by or restored to the Hudson's Bay Company, in whose
hands it finally remained, under the name of York Factory (<i>q.v.</i>).

<p><b>New Brunswick.</b> The gulf coast of the province was discovered by Cartier
in 1534; first settlement made by De Monts and Champlain, on St. Croix
Island, near the entrance to the Bay of Fundy, in 1604. The same year
they discovered and named the St. John River, at the mouth of which La
Tour built a fort in 1635. The territory embraced in this province
formed part of Acadie under French rule. It was included in Nova Scotia
from the date of the cession to England up to 1784, when it became a

<p><b>Newfoundland.</b> Discovered by Cabot in 1497. Sir Humphrey Gilbert
established a short-lived colony on the island in 1583. Another attempt
was made in 1610, by the Company of London. A more successful effort at
colonization was that of Lord Baltimore in 1621. For a time the colony
was governed by the so-called "Fishing Admirals," the most famous of
whom was Richard Whitbourne, author of <i>A Discourse and Discoverie of
Newfoundland</i>. French influence on the island dated from the founding of
Placentia in 1660. In 1696 Iberville captured St. John's, and laid waste
the coast settlements. St. John's was again captured by a French
squadron, in 1760. A Legislative Assembly was granted to the colony in
1832 as a result of popular agitation; and responsible government
established in 1855. Efforts to bring about the union of the island with
Canada were made in 1864, and again in 1895, but without success. <b>Index</b>:

the Ottawa, to learn their language. Remained with the tribe two years;
and afterwards spent eight or nine years with the Nipissings, gaining so
much of their confidence that he was made a member of the tribe and took
part in their councils. His memoirs on this tribe, furnished to Father
Le Jeune, were embodied in the <i>Jesuit Relations</i>. Returned to Quebec,
1633, after an absence of fifteen years. There met Champlain, who sent
him west once more, in 1634. Reached Green Bay the same year, and
ascended Fox River to the Wisconsin portage. The following year returned
to Quebec, and employed as commissary of the fur trade, and interpreter
at Three Rivers, till his death. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Arrives in Canada, 144. <b>Bib.</b>:

in 1727-1728, and acquired there much of the information which induced
him to undertake his long search for the Western Sea. In 1784 Édouard

<p><b>Ottawa Indians.</b> A tribe of the Algonquian family. First mentioned in
Champlain's narrative, 1615. The explorer met a party of these Indians
on French River. They were called the <i>Cheveux Relevés</i>, because of
their peculiar method of dressing the hair. They occupied Manitoulin
Island from about 1615 to 1650; were attacked and dispersed by the
Iroquois the latter year, and settled West of Green Bay. They were keen
fur traders, and throughout the greater part of the seventeenth century
continued to bring down quantities of furs from the west to Montreal by
way of the Ottawa River. Fought under Pontiac in 1763; made peace with
Sir William Johnson at Niagara in 1764. A few thousand are now scattered
on reservations in Ontario. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Keen for trade and cheap goods,

<p><b>Pacific Fur Company.</b> Organized by John Jacob Astor in 1810. Sometimes
known as the Astor Fur Company. Astor had made a fortune in the fur
trade, and formed the plan of extending his operations to the Pacific
coast, and building a post at the mouth of the Columbia. He suggested to
the North West Company that the project be undertaken jointly, but the
Company declining the offer, he induced several of its partners and
employees to join him. These men sailed to the Columbia by way of Cape
Horn, while another party went overland by the route followed by Lewis
and Clark. Astoria was built in 1811, at the mouth of the Columbia, but
the energetic competition of the North West Company, and complications
arising out of the War of 1812, defeated Astor's plans. <b>Index</b>: <b>D</b> Logical

<p><b>Pontbriand, Henri-Marie Dubreuil de</b> (1709-1760). Born in Vannes, France.
In 1741 consecrated bishop of Quebec, and left Paris for Canada. Soon
after his arrival in Quebec engaged in a lawsuit with the nuns of the
general hospital as to the ownership of the episcopal palace, which they
claimed Bishop Saint-Vallier had bequeathed to them. The king, however,
confirmed him in its possession. Another royal decree prohibited
religious congregations from holding lands in mortmain, but the bishop
refused to enforce it. In 1760, after the fall of Quebec, he appointed a
vicar-general, admonished the clergy to observe strictly the terms of
capitulation, and went to Montreal, where he died after a short illness.

Training colleges were established at Toronto, Halifax, Montreal, and
other centres. In 1861 the Free and United Presbyterian synods united as
the Synod of Canada Presbyterian Church; and in 1875 all Presbyterian
bodies became one in the Presbyterian Church in Canada. <b>Index</b>: <b>E</b> Secures

and both the discovery and naming of the island have been attributed to
Cabot, and again to Cartier, but without sufficient proof. It bore that
name until the year 1798,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> when the present form was adopted, in honour
of the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. During the French régime,
it was largely settled by Acadian families, but these were expelled
after the island came under British rule. In 1769 the island was granted
to a number of proprietors, and settlement was very slow. It formed part
of Nova Scotia until 1769, when it was made a separate province.

<p><b>Prince of Wales Fort.</b> At the mouth of the Churchill River, Hudson Bay.
Built by the Hudson's Bay Company, between the years 1733 and 1771. It
was of massive masonry, 37 to 42 feet thick; 310 feet long on the north
and south sides, and 317 on the east and west; and is said to have been
designed by English military engineers. The walls are still standing,
though parts have fallen in. The parapet mounted forty guns, which are
still on the walls. <i>See</i> Tyrrell's Introduction to Hearne's <i>Journey</i>

<p><b>Quebec City.</b> Founded by Champlain (<i>q.v.</i>), in 1608. Seventy-three years
earlier, Jacques Cartier had sailed up the great river, and landed near
the same spot, wintering in a creek not far from the native town of
Stadaconé. Champlain, in 1608, built a rude fort, the <i>Abitation de
Québec</i>, and a warehouse. There he and his men spent the winter, but
before succour arrived in the spring, most Of them died of scurvy. Had a
man of less courage and resourcefulness been in Command, the infant
settlement of Quebec might have died a natural death. Champlain kept it
alive, and, though harassed by enemies, and neglected by the motherland,
the town grew steadily from the year of its birth. Quebec has passed
through five sieges, that of Kirke in 1629, that of Phipps, 1690, the
great siege of 1759, Lévis's siege of 1760, and that of Montgomery and
Arnold, 1775-1776. <b>Index</b>: <b>Bk</b> The centre of society in Canada, 46;

<p><b>Quebec Library</b>. Founded at Quebec in 1779. The first public library in
what is now Canada. On Jan. 7 of that year, the following advertisement
appeared in the Quebec <i>Gazette</i>: "A subscription has been commenced for
establishing a publick library for the city and district of Quebec. It
has met with the approbation of His Excellency the Governor and of the
Bishop, and it is hoped that the institution, so particularly useful in
this country, will be generally encouraged." The idea of the library
originated with Governor Haldimand, and the first lot of books was
purchased in England, under his instructions, by Richard Cumberland, the
dramatist. An Act of incorporation obtained in 1840. Five years later,
the library was absorbed by the Quebec Library Association, founded
1843; and in 1866 the Association dissolved and sold its books to the
Quebec Literary and Historical Society (<i>q.v.</i>). <b>Bib.</b>: A detailed
account of the Quebec Library, and the Quebec Library Association, will
be found in Würtele's paper, in Quebec Lit. and Hist. Soc. <i>Trans.</i>,
1887-1889.</p>

<p><b>Quebec Literary and Historical Society</b>. Founded at Quebec in 1824,
largely through the influence and liberality of the Earl of Dalhousie,
then governor-general. Its purposes were "to discover and rescue from
the unsparing hand of time the records which yet remain of the earliest
history of Canada. To preserve while in our power, such documents as may
be found amid the dust of yet unexplored depositories, and which may
prove important to general history and to the particular history of this
province." In 1829, another similar organization was absorbed; and in
1831 the society was incorporated by Act of Parliament. The library had
been started the previous year, as well as the museum. Both have grown
steadily, despite serious losses from fires. <b>Bib.</b>: The publications
consist of <i>Transactions</i> and <i>Historical Documents</i>. The first volume
of the former appeared in 1829, and the first part of the latter in
1838. The <i>Trans.</i>, for 1887-1889 contain an account of the Society, its
publications and its library, by F. C. Würtele, who also published in
1891 an Index to the series of publications.</p>

<p><b>Quebec, Province of</b>. Area 351,873 square miles. Formed the principal
part of Canada, as ceded to Britain in 1763. Under the Quebec Act, 1774,
its boundaries extended west to the Ohio and Mississippi. In 1791, the
province was divided into Upper and Lower Canada, with the Ottawa River
as the boundary; in 1841 the two provinces were again united; and in
1867, Quebec became a province of the Dominion. The period of military
rule extended from the conquest to 1764, when civil government was
established. In 1775 the first Legislative Council met at Quebec.
Constitutional government was established in 1791; and responsible
government in 1841. <b>Index</b>: <b>Dr</b> Government of, embraced Canada, 7. <b>S</b>

<p><b>Quebec, Siege of, 1629.</b> The previous year, David Kirke had sailed up the
river, and sent a demand for the surrender of the fort, which Champlain
peremptorily refused. Kirke thereupon returned to the gulf to meet the
French fleet under De Roquemont, which he captured after a battle which
lasted fifteen hours, and carried his prizes and prisoners back to
England. The following year he returned, with a fleet of three sails,
and Champlain surrendered the fort, the more readily as the little
garrison was at the point of starvation. <b>Index</b>: <i>See</i> Quebec City;

<p><b>Quebec, Siege of, 1690.</b> Sir William Phipps, having captured Port Royal
in May of this year, appeared before Quebec in October, with thirty-two
ships and a force of over two thousand men. He immediately summoned
Frontenac to surrender, and got a contemptuous refusal. Quebec was well
defended both in men and guns, and after a fruitless attack on the town
from the Beauport flats, and a subsequent bombardment in which he did
much less damage to the town than his ships suffered from Frontenac's
batteries, Phipps abandoned the siege. A little church then building in
the Lower Town was named <i>Notre Dame de la Victoire</i>, to commemorate the
victory. <b>Index</b>: <i>See</i> Quebec city; Phipps. <b>Bib.</b>: Myrand, <i>Sir William

<p><b>Quebec, Siege of, 1759.</b> Following the capture of Louisbourg, Duquesne,
and Fort Frontenac, in the campaign of 1758, two expeditions were sent
the following year against Quebec, one by land under Amherst, the second
by water under Wolfe and Saunders. The French forces were commanded by
Montcalm, whose plans were hampered at every stage by the interference
of the governor, Vaudreuil. Wolfe commanded the attacking army, and
Saunders the fleet. The former had as brigadiers Townshend, Monckton,
and Murray. Montcalm had a force of over fourteen thousand men, partly
regulars and partly militia. Wolfe's army numbered less than nine
thousand men, but all were regulars. After bombarding the city from the
Lévis shore, Wolfe, on July 31, made an unsuccessful attack at
Montmorency. Several ineffective efforts followed, and it was not until
early in September that Wolfe matured the plans which led to ultimate
success. Landing his men at a cove two miles above the city, on the
night of the twelfth, he had three thousand men upon the heights of
Abraham before daybreak. Montcalm hastily assembled his troops and led
them to the attack, but was completely defeated. During the battle, both
Wolfe and Montcalm were mortally wounded, and five of the French
brigadiers fell upon the field. The French were pursued to the gates of
the city, and Townshend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> who had succeeded to the command, had
difficulty in re-forming his troops to repel an attack from the rear by
Bougainville. The latter, however, after a brief engagement, was forced
to retire; and the British remained masters of the field. Five days
later, the city capitulated to Saunders and Townshend. <b>Index</b>: <i>See</i>

Murray retreated within the walls of Quebec, and Lévis laid siege to the

by forming a wall of ice. In May a British fleet appeared, and Lévis,
seeing that the cause was lost, hastily raised the siege. <b>Bib.</b>: Bradley,

<p><b>Queenston Heights, Battle of.</b> In War of 1812. Brock commanded the
British forces, consisting of regulars and militia, between 1500 and
2000 men, scattered along the Niagara River from Fort Erie to Fort
George. The opposing American forces numbered about 6000 men, similarly
distributed on the south bank of the river, under Stephen Van
Rensselaer. In the first skirmish, a few hundred men only were engaged
on either side, and the Americans finally gained the heights, brought up
reinforcements, and remained in possession for several hours. The
British losses included Brock and Macdonell. Sheaffe, on whom the
command had devolved, gathered together the scattered detachments of
British troops, 1000 strong, and marching them through the woods,
attacked the Americans from the inland side, and completely defeated
them. Many were driven over the banks into the river, and between 900
and 1000 surrendered, including Major-General Wadsworth and
Lieutenant-Colonel Winfield Scott. <b>Index</b>: <b>Bk</b> Account of battle, 300-312.

1651, and settled at Three Rivers. In 1652 captured by the Iroquois and
carried off to their country, where by great good fortune he escaped the
following year. In 1657 had the hardihood to make a voluntary visit to
the Onondagas; in 1658 explored the country south-west of Lake Superior,
discovered the Mississippi, and possibly went beyond. In 1661 made
another journey to the west, accompanied as on the previous journey by
his brother-in-law, Medard Chouart; wintered among the Sioux, and the
following year explored the country north of Lake Superior, and
apparently penetrated to James Bay. In 1665 went to England and offered
his services to lead a trading expedition to Hudson Bay. The result of
this trading venture was the establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company.
In 1674, returned to the service of France, led an expedition to Hudson
Bay in 1682, and captured an English ship. In 1684 once more changed his
allegiance, and from that year to the time of his death remained in the
service of the Hudson's Bay Company. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Proceedings of, in Hudson

<p><b>Rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada.</b> The culmination of a long agitation,
on the part of the French-Canadians, for a larger measure of popular
government. The older and more experienced of their leaders refused to
overstep the bounds of constitutional agitation; but Papineau, Wolfred
Nelson, and a few more hot-headed enthusiasts determined to resort to
armed rebellion. A series of violent speeches and demonstrations, in the
summer and autumn of 1837, in which Papineau was the central figure, led
to incipient riots in Montreal and elsewhere, and the decision of the
authorities to arrest Papineau blew the smoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>ing embers into a
fierce blaze. Nelson and Brown gathered their followers together at St.
Denis and St. Charles on the Richelieu, and Colonel Gore and Colonel
Wetherall were sent to disperse them. Shortly after, Amury Girod raised
the flag of revolt at St. Eustache, and Sir John Colborne led a force
against him. In every case the rebels were dispersed. Papineau, Nelson,
Brown, and the other leaders fled. Papineau and Brown escaped over the
border. The others were captured and exiled to Bermuda. The next year
Robert Nelson and Dr. Côte made a final attempt at Napierville. Nelson
managed to escape, but his misguided followers were captured, twelve
executed, and eighty-seven transported to Australia. <b>Index</b>: <b>C</b>

<p><b>Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada.</b> Almost the exact counterpart of the
revolt in the lower province. The leaders here were William Lyon
Mackenzie, Samuel Lount, Van Egmond, and Rolph. The plan was to march
upon Toronto, seize the city, and proclaim a republic. This was early in
December. On the night of the 5th, the insurgents marched on the city,
were met on the outskirts by a small body of Loyalists, and
ignominiously fled. The following day, having gained reinforcements,
they made a stand at Montgomery's tavern, and were completely routed by
the militia under MacNab. Mackenzie, Lount, and Rolph made their escape.
Lount was afterwards captured, tried, and hanged. Spasmodic efforts were
made in this and the following years, with the aid of American
sympathizers, to keep the Rebellion alive, but the movement had no
serious support in Canada, and in every case ended in disaster to the
rebels. <b>Index</b>: <b>Mc</b> Excuses for, 12; history of, 12-13; <i>Globe</i> justifies,

<p><b>Reciprocity.</b> Efforts were made from time to time by Canada, between the
years 1847 and 1854, to secure the free admission of goods between
Canada and the United States, but without success until the latter year,
when Lord Elgin negotiated a treaty. It came into force in 1855, and was
abrogated in 1866, at the instance of the United States. The renewal of
the treaty was urged by Canada in 1866, 1869, 1871, 1874, 1879, 1887,

<p><b>Red River.</b> Sometimes called Red River of the North, to distinguish it
from the Red River of Texas. The name is supposed to have been derived
from the colour of its waters, heavily impregnated with clay. It was
discovered by La Vérendrye in 1733, and explored as far as the mouth of
the Assiniboine in that year. The river rises in North Dakota, and
enters Lake Winnipeg after a course of 545 miles. <b>Bib.</b>: Lovell,

<p><b>Red River Colony.</b> Also known as the Red River Settlement; Selkirk
Colony; Assiniboia, etc. Founded by the Earl of Selkirk (<i>q.v.</i>), in
1811. The first party of colonists from Scotland reached York Factory
that year, under the leadership of Miles Macdonell, and arrived at the
Red River in 1812. A second party was sent out in 1812, reaching Red
River in 1813. In that same year a third party sailed from the Orkneys,
reaching their destination in 1814; and in 1815 a still larger party, in
charge of Robert Semple, sailed for Hudson Bay and reached Red River the
same year. The colonists suffered great privations for the first few
years, and were constantly harassed by the fur traders of the North West
Company. This petty warfare culminated in the Seven Oaks affair, in
which Governor Semple lost his life. After the union of the two fur
Companies, in 1821, the colony entered upon a period of comparative
peace and prosperity; and eventually became, in 1870, part of the
province of Manitoba. <b>Index</b>: <b>MS</b> The settlers sail from Stornoway, in the

<p><b>Responsible Government.</b> The period of responsible government in Canada
dates from the union of 1841; in Nova Scotia, from 1848; in New
Brunswick, the same year; in Prince Edward Island, 1851. The agitation
for responsible government, from its very nature, cannot be limited to
an exact period. It was a gradual growth, whose roots ran back almost to
the beginning of the period of British rule in Canada. The Quebec Act of
1774, the Constitutional Act of 1791, the Ninety-Two Resolutions of
1834, the Rebellion of 1837, and Durham's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> Report, were mile-stones on

<p><b>Riel Rebellion</b>, 1869-1870. The territorial rights of the Hudson's Bay
Company having been transferred to Canada, a surveying party under
Colonel Dennis was sent out to Red River in 1869, and the same year
William Macdougall was appointed lieutenant-governor of Rupert's Land,
and instructed to proceed to Fort Garry and assume control. The French
half-breeds, alarmed at these proceedings, which they thought menaced
the rights to their lands, turned back the surveying parties, and
prevented Macdougall from crossing the boundary. They formed themselves
into a provisional government, of which Louis Riel was secretary, and
later was elected president. Riel published a "Bill of Rights," and
seized Fort Garry. An ill-judged attempt on the part of some of the
loyal settlers to compel the release of certain prisoners failed, and
the leader, Major Boulton, with Thomas Scott and others, was captured.
Boulton was released, but Riel caused Scott to be shot. Intense
indignation throughout Canada was aroused by this act, and the
government at once organized an expeditionary force, under Colonel
Wolseley. The force proceeded by way of the lakes, and the Dawson route
from Fort William to Lake Winnipeg. Wolseley reached Fort Garry on Aug.
24, 1870, to find that Riel, with his lieutenants Lepine and O'Donoghue,
had fled across the border. Riel was subsequently outlawed. <b>Index</b>: <b>C</b> Its

<p><b>Riel Rebellion</b>, 1885. The land question, which had given rise to the Red
River Rebellion of 1869-1870, was also responsible for the Saskatchewan
Rebellion of 1885. The government had neglected to issue patents to the
half-breeds on the Saskatchewan, and they became convinced that their
lands would be taken from them. Riel was sent for, and an agitation
worked up, at first along peaceful lines, but rapidly moving towards
violence. Riel finally threw discretion to the winds, and deliberately
inflamed not only the half-breeds, but also the western tribes. A small
detachment of Mounted Police and volunteers was attacked at Duck Lake,
and the government at Ottawa, hitherto indifferent, awoke to the
seriousness of the situation. A force was organized, and sent west under
General Middleton. Middleton divided his force into three columns; one
under General Strange, to operate against Big Bear in the neighbourhood
of Edmonton; the second under Colonel Otter, to relieve Battleford,
which was threatened by Poundmaker; and the third, of which he himself
took command, to relieve Prince Albert. Middleton met the rebels at Fish
Creek, and experienced a stubborn resistance, but drove them back to
Batoche. Here Riel and his men held the troops at bay for three days,
but were finally routed and scattered. Meanwhile Otter had encountered
Poundmaker at Cut Knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> Creek, and after a desperate fight had been
forced to retreat. In the far west, Strange had a similar experience
with Big Bear, but finally drove him to the north. Big Bear gave himself
up; Poundmaker and Riel were captured, and the latter paid the penalty
of his crimes on the scaffold. <b>Index</b>: <i>See also</i> Riel. <b>Bib.</b>: Boulton,

<p><b>Roberval, Jean François de la Roque, Sieur de.</b> A gentleman of Picardy,
born about the year 1500. By a commission dated Jan. 15, 1541, Francis I
gave him the command of the expedition planned by Jacques Cartier, and
made him his viceroy and lieutenant-general in the new lands discovered
by Cartier. The commission granted to the latter in 1540 was revoked,
and Cartier sailed as Roberval's lieutenant. Cartier left St. Malo in
May, 1541, and Roberval did not follow until April, 1542. His ships
entered the harbour of St. John's, Newfoundland, June 8, and there he
met Cartier on his way home. Sailing on into the gulf, and up the St.
Lawrence, he reached Charlesbourg Royal, where Cartier had wintered, and
set his men to work erecting forts and other buildings. Here he
wintered; explored the river in the spring; and sailed back to France
with his colonists in the autumn of 1543. Despite the failure of his
colonizing venture, commissioned by the king in 1544 to rebuild the
fortifications of Senlis; and in 1548 made controller of all mines in
France. Lost sight of about the year 1560. One story has it that he was
murdered in the streets of Paris; and another that he died at sea; but
both lack confirmation. There is reason to believe that he died in 1560,
or early in 1561. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Ravages of scurvy in his expedition, 23.

<p><b>Roman Catholic Church</b>. The first authentic landmark in the history of
the Roman Catholic Church in Canada is the arrival of several Jesuit
missionaries in Acadia in 1611. The Récollets first came to Quebec in
1615, and the Jesuits in 1625. In 1657 the Sulpicians arrived in
Montreal, and the following year Canada was made a Vicariate Apostolic.
The Jesuit missionaries explored the most distant parts of the
continent, in labouring among the Indians. Laval, the first
vicar-apostolic of New France, arrived in Quebec in 1659. In 1674 Quebec
was made a diocese, and Laval became the first bishop. After 1818 Canada
was divided into the dioceses of Nova Scotia, Upper Canada, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton, and the North-West. In
1841 the chapter of Montreal was established, and in 1874 the diocese of
Quebec was subdivided into eight dioceses. The first cardinal of Canada
was Archbishop Taschereau. <b>Index</b>: <b>Sy</b> Its members excluded from certain

Prince Rupert, after whom the territories were named. The Company's
title was repeatedly challenged, but its validity was always upheld by
the law officers of the crown. In 1869 the territories were transferred
to Canada, for the sum of £300,000, the company retaining certain blocks
of land around their trading-posts and one-twentieth of the arable land
of the country. <i>See also</i> Hudson's Bay Company; North-West Territories.</p>

<p><b>Sable Island.</b> Off the coast of Nova Scotia. It was known from about the
beginning of the sixteenth century as Santa Cruz, and so appears on
Reinel's map of 1505, and on the Cabot <i>mappemonde</i> of 1544. First
appears under its present name on a map of Joannes Freire, dated 1546.
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed for the island in 1583, and lost one of his
ships among its treacherous shoals. He mentions that above thirty years
before, the Portuguese had placed neat cattle and swine upon it to
breed, and that these had multiplied exceedingly. In 1598 La Roche left
fifty convicts upon the island, while he explored the coast, but his
little ship was blown out to sea, and he returned to France without
them. Five years later a ship was sent out to rescue the survivors,
eleven in all. The earliest description of the island is in De Laet's
<i>Novus Orbis</i>, 1633. It is at present twenty miles long, by about a mile
wide, and is wasting away rapidly. At the end of the eighteenth century,
it was forty miles long by two and a half wide; and when white men first
visited the island, it must have been of quite a considerable size.

<p><b>San Juan Boundary.</b> Dispute arose between the United States and Great
Britain out of a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the phrase
"middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver
Island" in the treaty of 1846, and by which the rightful possession of
San Juan and other islands in the vicinity for years remained unsettled.
A compromise was made in 1859, both governments jointly occupying San
Juan with troops. Finally, by the Washington Treaty of 1871, the
question was referred to the arbitration of the German emperor, who
decided in favour of the United States. <b>Index</b>: <b>Md</b> Brought up under

<p><b>Saskatchewan.</b> Organized as a provisional district in 1882. It then
extended from long. 111° 20' W. to the Manitoba boundary and Lake
Winnipeg, and from the northern boundary of the district of Assiniboia,
to the southern boundary of Athabaska. The province of Saskatchewan,
created in 1905, extends from long. 110° on the west to the Manitoba
boundary on the east, extended north to lat. 60°, which forms the
northern boundary of the new province. The capital of the province is

<p><b>Saskatchewan River.</b> Ultimate source is at the head waters of the Bow
River, about lat. 51° 40', in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. After a
course of 1205 miles, it flows into Lake Winnipeg, finally discharging
its waters by the Nelson into Hudson Bay. The length of the South
Saskatchewan to its junction with the North Saskatchewan at the Forks is
865 miles; and of the North Saskatche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>wan, which rises in the watershed
range of the Rocky Mountains, near the source of the Athabaska, is 760
miles. La Vérendrye reached the river, then known as the Pasquia, or
Poskoyac, in 1748, and built Fort Bourbon on the shores of Cedar Lake.
He ascended the river to the Forks, a few miles below which he built
Fort Poskoyac. In 1751 a party of French explorers ascended one of the
branches to the mountains, where they built Fort La Jonquière. Anthony
Hendry reached the Saskatchewan from Hudson Bay in 1754, and descended
the river from the upper waters of the Red Deer, to the Pas. Many
trading posts were afterwards built at different points on the two
branches, both by the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company.

<p><b>Seigniorial Tenure.</b> The history of this feudal system of land tenure,
transplanted from Old to New France, dates back to the commission of the
Sieur de la Roche, 1598, in which he is empowered to make grants in the
form of fiefs, seigniories, etc., to persons of merit. Up to 1627, when
the Company of New France (or the Company of One Hundred Associates) was
chartered, only three seigniories had been granted, two to colonial
laymen and the third to the Jesuit Order. Thereafter a large number of
seigniorial grants were made&mdash;no less than sixty between 1632 and 1663,
when the Company surrendered its rights to the crown. Details as to the
later history of Seigniorial Tenure in Canada, how it was applied to the
land, and why it outlived the same system in Old France, will be found
in the works cited below. The system was abolished in Canada in 1854.

<p><b>Sulpicians.</b> A Canadian order, founded by Jean Jacques Olier, in 1640, as
part of the threefold religious settlement of Ville Marie. Named after
Olier's parish of St. Sulpice, in Paris. After Maisonneuve had laid the
foundations of Montreal, the Sulpicians built their Seminary, and became
proprietors of the island, much of which still remains in their
possession. They encouraged settlement on their seigniory, and in 1666,
when Queylus was superior, granted a large tract of land at Lachine to
La Salle. Among the notable members of the order in its early days were
the Abbé Fénelon and Dollier de Casson, the latter the historian of the
order. <b>Index</b>: <b>F</b> Religious order, come to Montreal with Maisonneuve, 42;

in 1622. In the next quarter century the devoted Jesuit Fathers
penetrated to the shores of the lake. Jogues and Raymbault preached the
Faith at the outlet of the lake in 1641; Ménard attempted a mission on

<p><b>Thurlow, Edward, Baron</b> (1731-1806). Born in Norfolk, England. Entered
Parliament for Tamworth, 1768. In 1770 appointed solicitor-general, and
in 1771 attorney-general. In 1774 supported on constitutional grounds
the ministerial scheme for the government of Quebec province. In 1778
lord chancellor and raised to the peerage. Presided at the trial of
Warren Hastings, 1788. Supported Pitt's foreign policy throughout, but
on other questions was not a loyal adherent of the prime minister. In
1792 Pitt and Grenville, with whom he then bitterly disagreed, induced
the king to part with the chancellor, who then resigned the great seal.
Throughout his career an ardent supporter of the king, and added all his
influence in favour of the policy which led to the revolt of the
American colonies. <b>Index</b>: <b>Dr</b> Attorney-general, on French-Canadian claims

1755-1756, on a promontory at the southern end of Lake Champlain, where
it formed the advanced post of the French, and guarded the frontier from
British attack. Abercromby brought an army against it in 1758, and was
badly beaten by Montcalm. The following year Amherst captured the fort,
Bourlamaque retreating down the lake with his force. In 1775 it was
taken by the Americans, under Ethan Allen; and recaptured in 1777 by
Burgoyne, remaining in the possession of the British until the close of
the war. When the boundary was settled, it became the property of the
United States. <b>Index</b>: <b>Ch</b> Scene of fight with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span> Iroquois, 54. <b>Hd</b>

<p><b>Tonquin.</b> An American vessel, which brought out the Astorians from New
York to the Columbia in 1810. She was commanded by a domineering
officer, Captain Thorn. The following year, accompanied by Alexander
McKay, one of the partners of Astor's company, Thorn sailed north on a
trading expedition. At Nootka, while trading with the natives, he struck
one of the principal chiefs and turned him out of the ship. A few days
later a large party of Indians came on board, ostensibly to trade, but
carrying concealed weapons. At a preconcerted signal, they fell on the
officers and crew, killing all but five seamen, who escaped into the
hold. Four of these escaped the following day in a boat, but perished at
sea. The natives, believing the ship deserted, come on board in a crowd
to pillage her. Suddenly, while four or five hundred were huddled
together on the deck, the ship blew up with a frightful noise. The
sailor who had remained behind, probably wounded, is supposed to have
taken this terrible revenge. An Indian of Gray's Harbour, who had been
among the crew, managed to escape during the massacre, and brought the
news to Astoria. <b>Index</b>: <b>D</b> Attacked by natives at Clayoquot Sound, June,

instruction in practical astronomy. Between 1790 and 1792 made a survey
of Lake Athabaska, and of the canoe route from Cumberland House to Great
Slave Lake. Dr. J. G. Kohl says that his manuscript journal of a
<i>Journey from Cumberland-house towards the Athapiscow Country and back
to York Factory, 1790-1792</i>, is preserved in the archives of the
Hudson's Bay Company at London. His map of this region, the original of
which is also in the Hudson's Bay Archives, is reproduced in Burpee's
<i>Search for the Western Sea</i>. His careful survey of Lake Athabaska was
important in that it corrected Peter Pond's crude map, which placed the
western end of the lake as far west as 131°, and so gave rise to the
impression that the lake was within easy reach of the Pacific Ocean.

again became a separate province, under the name of Ontario (<i>q.v.</i>).

<p><b>Vancouver Island.</b> The largest island on the west coast of North America.
Named after Captain George Vancouver, who explored this coast in the
years 1792-1794. The island was first named Quadra and Vancouver in
honour of the two naval officers who met at Nootka in 1792 to carry out
the provisions of the Nootka Convention. The first authentic landing on
the coast of the island is that of Captain James Cook in 1787. Captain
James Hanna landed at Nootka in 1785; and Captain John Meares in 1788.
From this time trading and exploring expeditions spent more or less time
at Nootka. In 1843 the Hudson's Bay Company made their first
establishment on the island, Fort Victoria, at first known as Camosun.
The island remained under the control of the Company until 1849, when it
became a crown colony. Representative government was introduced, 1856;
and in 1866 the island and mainland were united under one government.

<p><b>Verrazano, Giovanni du.</b> Born near Florence, Italy, in 1470. Entered
French marine service, 1495. Credited with visiting the coast of
America, 1508. In 1523 sent by Francis I to explore to the westward. The
following year arrived with La Dauphine off the coast of North America,
and explored from Florida to Newfoundland, taking possession of the
latter island in the name of the king of France. Landed at a point near
Cape Fear, and discovered the bays of Narragansett and New York. Nothing
is known of his latter years, beyond the fact that he was in Paris, at
least as late as Dec. 24, 1527, fitting out an expedition of five ships
to sail the following March. Verrazano's claim to the discovery of the
mouth of the Hudson, questioned by Murphy, has been re-established by
the discovery in Rome of a hitherto unknown version of the explorer's
report of his voyage. <i>See</i> Bacchiani's article, with facsimile, in the

grounds for war as follows: Non-revocation of the orders-in-council;
interference with American trade; practical blockade of American ports;
impressment of American seamen, and the instigation of Indian
hostilities against the United States. The original intention of the
American government was the conquest of the British provinces on the
northern border, and several of the most important engagements were
fought on Canadian soil. After severe fighting with varying success, a
treaty of peace was signed at Ghent on Dec. 24, 1814. By this treaty all
territory taken by either country (except some islands on the Bay of
Passamaquoddy) was to be restored. All the American claims that led to
the war were left unsettled by the treaty. <b>Index</b>: <b>R</b> Loyalty of

<p><b>X Y Company.</b> Founded at Montreal in 1795 by several partners of the

of the old company, and particularly resented the autocratic ways of its
chief, Simon McTavish, popularly known among the fur traders, because of
his domineering manner, as "Le Premier," and "Le Marquis." The backbone
of the new concern was the powerful Montreal firm of Forsyth, Richardson
&amp; Co. Alexander Mackenzie was almost persuaded to join the new company
in 1795, but did not actually do so until 1801. Meanwhile the X Y
Company had built a post at Grand Portage in 1797, and followed their
rivals to the Assiniboine, the Saskatchewan, the Athabaska, and even
into the remote Peace River country. On the death of McTavish, in 1804,
the two companies were united as the North West Company. <b>Index</b>: <b>MS</b>
